# Why Gradle?

Gradle has been around for a while as a Java build tool.
Its power and expressiveness make it sometimes challenging to approach.
And thus the question is: why should I take the time to learn Gradle?

After gaining a basic understanding of Gradle build scripts for a Java project, we will look into the features that make Gradle shine.
Through work avoidance, parallelisation and caching, you will see how Gradle keeps build time low even for complex projects and how this can significantly impact development workflow for you and your team.

Then we will dove in the innovations of version 6.0, in particular those around dependency management.
Based on specific examples, you will understand better what is possible with Gradle and how it can help you escape "Dependency Hell".

After this session you will understand why the Grade can give you "Build happiness"!
