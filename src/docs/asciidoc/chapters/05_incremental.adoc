== Incremental builds

=== Why does it matter?

* Gradle is meant for incremental builds
* `clean` is a waste of time

=== The _incrementality_ test

[%step]
* Run a build
* Run again with no change
* If a task was re-executed, time is wasted
[%step]
** Investigate!

=== Tasks as functions

* What are the task inputs?
* What are the task outputs?
* What if one of them changes?

=== Know why your task is out-of-date

=== Incremental task inputs

* Know precisely _which_ files have changed
* Task action can perform the minimal amount of work
