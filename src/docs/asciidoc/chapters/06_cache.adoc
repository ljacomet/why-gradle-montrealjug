== Build cache

=== How does it work?

With up-to-date checks, Gradle is:
[%step]
* Reusing results
* Rrom *last time*
* When we ran *this build*
* On *this machine*

=== Gradle can do better

=== Why not...

Have Gradle:
[%step]
* Reuse results
* From *anytime before*
* When we ran *any build*
* On *this machine*

=== Or even better ...

Reuse results +
from *anytime before*  +
when we ran *any build* +
 *anywhere*.

=== Builds on top of incremental builds

[%step]
* Get reliable incremental builds first
* Next work on making them cacheable
* Cacheable tasks require additional information for path sensitivity

=== Repeatable outputs

[%step]
* Same inputs must produce same outputs
* May be byte-for-byte equivalent
* May be semantically equivalent (with normalization)

=== Normalization

[%step]
* `@InputFiles` - no normalization
* `@CompileClasspath` - Extracts ABI from classes
* `@Classpath` - treats files as a runtime Java classpath
** Configurable runtime normalization to ignore some files

=== Deploying a build cache

* Stable for Java, Groovy and Scala projects
* Gradle Enterprise provides a backend for managing, monitoring and replicating caches
* Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/gradle/build-cache-node/[gradle/build-cache-node]
